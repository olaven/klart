# Klart ![Tests](https://github.com/olaven/klart/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

## About 
Klart is a simple wrapper around [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres). It provides 
a simple interface to make queries towards a PostgreSQL database. Like [Kall](https://github.com/olaven/kall), Klart grew out of my work on [Krets](https://krets.app). The current featureset is therefore limited to what I have needed there. However, releasing Klart as a separate module is the first step into giving it a life of its own. In other words, feel free to reach out with any suggestions of how it could be expanded!

## Installation
